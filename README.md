## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a squid (clearly not a human) who enjoys coding and is actively enrolled in high school >:(. Mostly a self-taught coder who will probably get a job in some software development area but I have no idea :/

### Stuff I've been doing ðŸ”­
- Working with AI and LLMS
- Coding Discord bots (some featuring LLMS :)
- Making Minecraft stuff including modpacks
- Giving old tech new life by building an ultra-budget homelab :0
